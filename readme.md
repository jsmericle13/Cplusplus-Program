Grocery-Tracking Program (CS 210 Project Three)

Summary

This C++ program solves the problem of tracking grocery items purchased by users. It allows searching for item frequencies, listing all item frequencies, and displaying histograms, with automatic backup to a file. It demonstrates file handling, use of maps for data storage, and creating maintainable, readable C++ code.

What I Did Particularly Well

I implemented a clean, modular design using a dedicated ItemTracker class to encapsulate logic. The program follows best practices for file I/O, user interaction, and error handling, resulting in a user-friendly experience.

Areas for Improvement

The code could be enhanced by adding better error checking for file operations (e.g., verifying file open success) and input validation for menu selections. Improvements like these would make the code even more secure and robust against unexpected user behavior.

Most Challenging Pieces

The most challenging part was designing the histogram and managing dynamic user input cleanly inside a loop structure. I overcame these challenges by:

Reading C++ documentation on std::map and input handling.
Practicing modular design to isolate problems into functions.
I also added resources like C++ reference websites and debugging tools to my support network.

Transferable Skills

Skills from this project that are transferable include:

File I/O handling in C++.
Using maps and associative containers.
Designing modular and object-oriented code.
Writing maintainable and readable code.
These skills are useful for both future coursework and professional software development.

Code Maintainability

The program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable because:

It uses clear function names and documentation.
It separates concerns (menu display, logic processing, data backup).
The ItemTracker class isolates all data handling, making future updates (like adding more analysis features) easier.
