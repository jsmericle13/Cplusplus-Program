This project was created for The Gaming Room, a client that developed a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android and wanted to expand it to be accessible on web browsers across multiple platforms. The goal was to design a scalable, secure, and maintainable software solution that would support real-time multiplayer gameplay, platform independence, and a smooth user experience. The final software design document outlines a three-tier architecture using Java on the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL or Firebase for data storage.

One thing I did particularly well was organizing the document clearly and using object-oriented design principles to define the system’s structure. This included the use of design patterns like Singleton and Iterator, which helped manage shared resources and enforce name uniqueness. Working through this design document before coding helped clarify how the system should be structured, what entities needed to be created, and how they would interact. It also gave me a solid blueprint to follow when developing the application.

If I could improve one section, I would expand the risk assessment and evaluation portions of the document to address more deployment scenarios and potential technical challenges. I interpreted user needs by focusing on platform compatibility, low latency, and ease of use. Meeting user expectations is critical in software development because it ensures the final product is practical and provides a positive user experience.

To design this system, I used techniques like domain modeling, architectural planning, and design pattern implementation. In future projects, I plan to continue using these strategies along with tools like UML diagrams and CI/CD pipelines to analyze requirements and plan scalable, maintainable applications.
