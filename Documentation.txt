CS 210 Project Three: Grocery-Tracking Program

Overview:
This C++ program allows users to track grocery items purchased using a menu-driven interface. It reads data from a file and outputs both frequencies and histograms of item occurrences. The program utilizes a class (ItemTracker) with private and public sections and demonstrates industry standard best practices, including file I/O, encapsulation, and maps.

Key Features:
- Option 1: Search item frequency
- Option 2: List all items with frequency
- Option 3: Display histogram of items
- Option 4: Exit the program

Backup:
Automatically creates a frequency.dat file containing item names and their frequencies.
